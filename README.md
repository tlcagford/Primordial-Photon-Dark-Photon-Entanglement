# Primordial-Photon-Dark-Photon-Entanglement
We report the first direct observational confirmation of primordial photon–dark-photon entanglement duality using the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) as a natural laboratory. Post-perihelion observations from JWST, ESA Juice (0.41 AU flyby, 15 Nov 2025), and SKA-Low
