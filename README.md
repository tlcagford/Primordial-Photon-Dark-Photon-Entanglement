*Numerical simulation of quantum entanglement between photons and dark photons in the early universe*

## 📖 Abstract

This repository contains the complete code and data for studying primordial entanglement between photons and dark photons. We solve the von Neumann equation for a coupled photon-dark photon system in an expanding universe, quantifying the generation of quantum entanglement and its implications for dark matter.

### Option 1: Using conda (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tlcagford/Primordial-Photon-Dark-Photon-Entanglement.git
cd Primordial-Photon-Dark-Photon-Entanglement
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate primordial-entanglement
python src/main.py
