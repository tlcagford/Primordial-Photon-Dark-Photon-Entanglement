## 🔬 Research Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation for studying quantum entanglement between standard model photons and dark photons in the early universe, and its implications for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization.

## 📚 Theoretical Framework

We investigate the quantum dynamics of photon-dark photon oscillations mediated by kinetic mixing:

\\[
\\mathcal{L} \\supset -\\frac{\\epsilon}{2} F^{\\mu\\nu}F'_{\\mu\\nu}
\\]

The resulting entanglement entropy and CMB signatures provide novel probes of dark sector physics.
