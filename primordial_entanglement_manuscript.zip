For duality models (e.g., entangled light �� and dark �� sectors), introduce two scalar fields with minimal 
coupling but phase mismatch Δ� due to sector separation. The combined wave function is 
�=��+������. Each evolves via its own Schrödinger equation, but with shared or offset potentials.
Assume weak interaction (mixing parameter � ≪ 1):

∇��� +(Φ� +�Φ�)��,
with ∇�Φ� = 4��∣�� ∣�, ∇�Φ� = 4��∣�� ∣� (or offset for dark sector).
The interference density is:
� =∣�∣� =∣�� ∣�+∣��∣�+2ℜ(��

To derive fringes: Assume plane waves �� ∝ ��(��⋅�����), �� ∝ ��(��⋅�����). The cross-term oscillates with 
wavevector Δ� = �� −��, yielding fringe spacing:

This derivation shows how FDM waves emerge from scalar field theory, predicting interference patterns 
testable via offsets and NG accelerations. For numerical fits (e.g., to comet data), solve via Fourier 
methods or simulations
