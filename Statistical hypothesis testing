\subsection*{Statistical hypothesis testing}
Null hypothesis $H_0$: no photon–dark-photon entanglement; observables arise from instrument/systematic noise and astrophysical classical processes. Alternative $H_1$: entanglement produces a residual cross-correlation described by model $M(\varepsilon,m_{A'},\ldots)$. We compute a test statistic $T$ (e.g., Fisher-transformed Pearson correlation or likelihood ratio) and estimate its distribution under $H_0$ using $N_{\rm MC}=10^4$ Monte Carlo realizations (noise and systematics). Reported p-values are two-tailed and corrected for $k$ multiple spectral/temporal trials using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.
